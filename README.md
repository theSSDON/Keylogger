# Keylogger
This is a Keylogger Software.
You can run the .sh file to start the program.
The bash file can be edited to make the program run in the background or on startup.

A Python file runs the actual software and processes the keystrokes, which are saved in a log file
The log file can be sent through an SMTP server back to the attacker.


In a stiumlated example, the victim open a socail networking site, and the username and password of the user are recorded in the log file.
Similarly, another sample text is recorded in the log file.
